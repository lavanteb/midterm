    <p>Posted on October 11, 2018, at 9:43 p.m. ET</p>
    <p>For anyone who’s spent even a few hours in the online fever swamps of the pro-Trump media, Kanye West’s Oval Office rant feels exhaustingly familiar. Holding court as the president beamed from the other side of the Resolute Desk, West delivered a lengthy monologue cribbed from the “Recommended Next” algorithm that kicks in at the end of any Jordan Peterson YouTube video. Trump, West proclaimed, was on a “hero's journey.” The “Make America Great Again” hat he was wearing “made [him] feel like Superman.” There were hugs. It was the logical conclusion of a months-long saga: the red pilling of Kanye West.
